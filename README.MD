This is a challenge from dio.me, [BairesDev - Machine Learning Practitioner](https://web.dio.me/track/coding-the-future-baires-dev-machine-learning-practitioner), where I need to make a code to make dimensionality reduction, transforming a image into grey and binarized to reduce the number of features, I made it in Python and on Scilab.

In Python I used Matplotlib, Pillow and Numpy.

In Scilab I used an example avaible on help.
